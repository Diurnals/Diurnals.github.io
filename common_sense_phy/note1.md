# Two research trends

## Intensive research

goes for the fundamental laws

- high energy physics
- part of nuclear physics

## Extensive research

goes for the explanation of phenomena in terms of known fundamental laws

- solid state physcis
- plasma physics
- biology

# Symmetry

definition: the existence of different viewpoints from which the system appears the same.

## Example

- $NH_3$
  - has a dipole moment?
  - both is right
    - the mixuture does not have a dipole moment

## Three infuerences

- symmestry is of great importance
  - what if space and matter are homogeneous and isotropic?
- internal structure of a piece of matter need not to be symmetrical even if the total state of it is
- the state of a really big systems does not at all have to have the symmetry of the lawa govern it
  - crystal
  - superconductivity
    - new symmetry -- broken symmetry

# Next Stage

## regular system but contains information

- regular in space in some sense, but it contains elements which can be varied from one 'cell' to the next
  - DNA(information-bearing-crystallinity)
  - requires any further breaking of symmetry?

## temporal regularity in living objects

- set up a continuing process
  - time-periodic machines
    - oscillators
    - generators
- handling information, similar to information-bearing spatial regularity

## hierarchy or specialization of function

- stop talking about decreasing symmetry / start calling it increasing complication

- 复杂性的暴政
- 有的时候确实不用太拘泥于优雅，实用主义works
