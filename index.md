### topology in proteins

#### Project #1: 'link' in IDP

Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDP) play critical roles in various biological processes. However, their high flexibility presents a challenge in characterizing their intricate conformations using current methods. The aim of this project is to develop an effective and comprehensive topological analysis method for characterizing the structure of IDP. We utilize Gauss Linking Number (GLN) to calculate the relative position relationships of subchains and scan the whole chain to generate a matrix(denoted as GLN Map), which we then use to analyze the physical links and topological properties of IDP. 

Here is the movie of the dynamic process of linking revealed by GLN Map:

Furthermore, Link Nodes, key crossing points in physical link that affect the topological properties of the IDP chain, are extracted from the GLN map. Here is the movie of Link Node:

#### Project #2: knots in peptide

This project compares the probability of knots formation in various simulations(CG and AA).
